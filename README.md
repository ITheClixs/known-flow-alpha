## The question

When a new option-writing programme is born on a named underlying at a known date —
the launch of an options-income, covered-call, or defined-outcome ETF — its demand is
uninformed, calendar-scheduled, and publicly disclosed in daily holdings from day one.
Competitive liquidity provision says such demand should not move prices. It does.

This project asks how fast that gap closes:

> Does the price impact of a newly created, fully disclosed, calendar-scheduled option
> flow decay toward **zero** or toward a **strictly positive risk-bearing floor**, at
> what half-life, and is the residual exploitable net of realistic costs?

The object being estimated, per programme, is

```
λ(a) = λ∞ + (λ0 − λ∞) · exp(−a / h)
```

where `a` is programme age, `λ0` is impact at birth, `h` is the absorption half-life,
and `λ∞` is the equilibrium floor. Roughly 700 independent programme births since 2019
make this the first setting in which the formation of a sunshine-trading equilibrium
can be watched rather than inferred.

Why the floor need not be zero: a dealer absorbing an option position retains an
*unhedgeable* residual (jump risk, vol-of-vol, discrete hedging). Competitive entry
drives the rent to zero but not the risk premium.

## Why the answer matters either way

- **λ0 > λ∞ > 0 with finite h** — publicly known mechanical inefficiencies are absorbed
  at a finite, measurable rate, and the half-life is the shelf-life of any such edge.
- **λ0 ≈ λ∞ ≈ 0** — option markets absorb disclosed mechanical supply essentially
  instantly, bounding a widely asserted volatility-amplification channel to near zero.

Both are results. Neither is "the model did not work."

## Data policy

**Every input is free and public.** No WRDS, no OptionMetrics, no paid vendor feed.
The stated aim is that any reader can rebuild the entire dataset at zero cost.

| Source | What it gives | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Cboe delayed quotes CDN | Full option chain per symbol: bid/ask **with sizes**, IV, greeks, volume, open interest | Free, unauthenticated |
| OCC series search | Authoritative per-series open interest and position limits | Free, unauthenticated |
| Issuer daily ETF holdings | Exact strikes, expiries, contract counts held by each programme | Free |
| SEC EDGAR N-PORT | Position-level fund derivatives with counterparty, from Oct 2019 | Free |
| SEC EDGAR N-CEN / 485BPOS | Fund launch dates and prospectus roll calendars | Free |

Because the quote-bearing sources are **snapshot** endpoints with no history, a missing
day is unrecoverable. The collector therefore runs daily and isolates per-symbol
failures so one bad symbol never costs a whole capture.

## Layout

```
configs/universe.json      treated and control underlyings
src/absorb/config.py       paths, endpoints, tunables
src/absorb/collect/http.py shared session, retry, pacing
src/absorb/collect/cboe.py option chain snapshots
src/absorb/collect/occ.py  series-level open interest
src/absorb/collect/runner.py  one daily pass + audit manifest
src/absorb/cli.py          entry point
tests/                     parser and runner tests
```

## Usage

```bash
uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# one capture of everything
.venv/bin/absorb-collect

# a single source, to a scratch root
.venv/bin/absorb-collect --sources cboe --root /tmp/absorb-check

# tests
.venv/bin/pytest
```

Output is Parquet partitioned by capture date, plus a JSON manifest per run recording
row counts and a SHA-256 of every raw payload.
